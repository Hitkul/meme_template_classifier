Y U No,"
                            The Y U No meme actually began as Y U No Guy but eventually evolved into simply Y U No, the phrase being generally followed by some often ridiculous suggestion. Originally, the face of Y U No guy was taken from Japanese cartoon Gantz’ Chapter 55: Naked King, edited, and placed on a pink wallpaper. The text for the item reads “I TXT U … Y U NO TXTBAK?!” It appeared as a Tumblr file, garnering over 10,000 likes and reblogs.
It went totally viral, and has morphed into hundreds of different forms with a similar theme. When it was uploaded to MemeGenerator in a format that was editable, it really took off. The formula used was : “(X, subject noun), [WH]Y [YO]U NO (Y, verb)?”.
The Y U No figure stands with arms held out and fingers spread in a plaintive, almost begging gesture, looking pained that whoever the subject of his plea has not done something. Translated into regular English, the text would read “I Texted You, Why Have You Not Texted Me Back?”
Some other notable examples of Y U No include: “PAYPAL: Y U NO ACCEPT WIKILEAKS DONATIONS?”, “CONGRESS: Y U NO COMPROMISE ON THE DEBT CEILING?”, AND NASA: Y U NO FIND REAL ALIEN?”. Often the chosen subjects are famous people or institutions, but there also exist more general subjects, often focused on lack of communication or the little problems that arise in life.

Willy Wonka,"
                            
Willy Wonka Meme is an absolute classic and an emblem of the sarcasm that memes are born to express. 

Not only it was one of the first images to become a viral meme around 2010, but it is taken from one of the masterpieces of TV musical genre, Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory, produced in 1971. The protagonist of the musical, Willy Wonka (played by Gene Wilder) is the incarnation that subtle sarcasm and weirdness that meme culture seeks. One of his most condescending faces has been captured in this image and it is offered now to the large public by Meme Generator. 

Make your more sarcastic comment over people and situations and let Willy sublimate it with his skeptic view, half creepy smile and staring eyes.

If you want to generate a Willy Wonka meme for free, you are in the right place. In a couple of steps you will have your sarcastic comment framed in the perfect image, so that everybody will see “how interesting” you think they are. Remember that all our images are royalty free, so you will be really able to spread it as much as you want! All you have to do is click on the button “create a meme” and write a text of your choice that will appear on the image. We suggest you to use a rhetorical question on top of the image and your sarcastic remark at the bottom of it: the Willy Wonka condescending effect is granted!

The Most Interesting Man In The World,"
                            Dos Equis Beer was the starting point for this meme, featuring a live actor playing the role of The Most Interesting Man in the World. The company released a series of commercials with the character, with each one touting his extreme levels of interestingness. Aired locally in 2006, the ads gained much more attention when they went national in 2009.
Actor Jonathon Goldsmith is responsible for playing the role, with the recognizable voice of Will Lyman from Frontline doing the narration. The YouTube video went viral in 2009, reaching over one million views, although earlier, in 2007, the ad made Time Magazine’s top 10 TV ads list for that year.
The character has since taken a life of its own, and many places have featured the key catchphrases spoken at the end of the commercial: “I don’t always drink beer, but when I do, I prefer Dos Equis,”, and “Stay thirsty, my friends”.
The main meme parody that has sprung up from The Most Interesting Man in the World, is the modeling of a formula taken from one of the lines in the commercial: “I don’t always do X, but when I do, I Y”. Many videos parodying the ad have spring up since then, including the Least Interesting Man in the World, and the Most Interesting Warcraft Player in the World.

Futurama Fry,"
                            Futurama Fry shows the character from the television show Futurama named Fry as the subject of the meme. The photo is a screen shot, taken from the episode entitled “The Lesser of Two Evils”, and the moment captures Fry’s half-lidded expression at the moment after being discovered searching another character Leela’s underwear. Futurama is a wildly popular show for self-proclaimed geeks and nerds everywhere, and is a cartoon program for adults depicting life in the future. Fry is one of the main characters of the show.
The text surrounding the meme picture, as with other memes, follows a set formula. This phrasal template goes as follows: “Not sure if (insert thing)”, with the bottom line then reading “or just (other thing)”. It was first utilized in another meme entitled “I see what you did there”, where Fry is shown in two panels, with the first one with him in a wide-eyed expression of surprise, and the second one with the familiar half-lidded expression.
As an example of the phrasal template, Futurama Fry can be seen saying: “Not sure if just smart …. Or British”. Another example would be “Not sure if highbeams … or just bright headlights”. The main form of the meme seems to be with the text “Not sure if trolling or just stupid”.

Success Kid,"
                            If you come across the image of an adorable toddler, clenching a fistful of sand in his little toddler hand, you have probably come across Success Kid. This cheeky-faced angelic babe showed up some time in early 2008 and spread like wildfire across several social media platforms.
The early months of Success kid showed the picture of the baby with the tagline “Ima Fuck You Up”, making it both hilarious and NSFW. The determined expression on the child’s face struck a chord with viewers everywhere, and the image eventually morphed into the same photo with a different tagline, which also gained internet notoriety – “I Hate Sandcastles”. It was at that time that another little child appeared in the background of the photo.
Nowadays, yet another transition has been made, and the photo has become an Advice Dog variation, where different episodes of successful events have been related through the use of the photo and accompanying text.
Today you will see Success Kid spouting off all kinds of relevant and topical wisdom. Perhaps not always in the best of taste (e.g. “Congratulations Amy Winehouse On Being 3 Days Sober”), Success Kid nonetheless is hilarious and witty, saying many of the things we wish we could say but don’t have the guts to.
Yet another of his pearls of wisdom: “Get Sick on Friday – Three day weekend”. There is something so funny about the juxtaposition of an adorable little baby with such a fierce look of determination on his face, and that irony has helped usher Success Kid into one of the top tiers of meme recognition and appreciation.

One Does Not Simply,"
                            
Life is not easy even when people think it is. Unfortunately, sometimes they do not realize it and talk with such an easy going approach that you feel compelled to reveal them the deep truth about the complexity of even the tiniest actions. One not simply does stuff the right way and this might mean that the outcome will be completely wrong!

This revelatory, a bit paternalistic meme originates from a popular scene of the movie “Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring”, in which Boromir, High Warden of the White Tower, warns his fellow adventurers about the risks of entering in the region of Mordor to destroy the ring. Since you probably know the story, you realize also how his sentence “One does not simply walk into Mordor” was true and wise.

One does not Simply create a Meme… Except This!

One does not simply do stuff, but you are not a member of the Fellowship if the Ring (yet!) so relax: generating a meme at memegenerator.net is actually quite simple! Gather your strength and your courage, click one the “create a meme” button and prove yourself a real hero, writing the perfect advice for those who think that anything can be done easily.

If you wish to create something more unique, you can upload an image yourself and transform it in your personal meme. One does not simply create the next viral meme, but you can bravely try!

But what if your long time school mate, one day, takes your old picture from the school book and make one of the most hilarious memes on the net out of it, taking you as an emblem of a dorky nerd? This is how Kyle Craven, nowadays a normal American construction worker, has become “Bad Luck Brian”.

First World Problems,
Philosoraptor,"
                            Obviously, the best place to acquire philosophical musings is from a velociraptor. And the best velociraptor to go to in order to ponder the deeper meanings of life is Philosoraptor.
Philosoraptor muses about all the questions in our lives that we should be asking. Sure, Plato had some interesting thoughts. Aristotle made some minor contributions. But it was only Philosoraptor who had the courage, the fortitude, and the insight to ask: “If a vegetarian eats vegetables, does a humanitarian eat humans?” Indeed, these are valuable philosophical thoughts for our time.
The good old Philosoraptor will commonly show up on a single panel sticker or poster format, with a picture of his fine looking mug and whatever he is musing about shown in text around him. He goes where other humans and velociraptors fear to go in philosophical debates.
The intensely intelligent musings of the Philosoraptor are many. One of the prime locations for Philosoraptor to show up is at the office or at school. If you see a square-ish photo of a wildly intelligent looking dinosaur, chances are someone has displayed some of his wisdom.
The green, scaly pontificator himself is a large proponent of gay rights. You will find that he is able to pick apart and examine all the fallacies inherent in the poor treatment of gay people in society. Philosoraptor states: “Why do the religious say that sin is natural, but homosexuality is unnatural, even though they consider it a sin?” Good question, Philosoraptor. Good question.

Grumpy Cat ,"
                            
The Grumpy Cat meme is the revenge of your real self on the external world. Annoyance, cynicism and anger at different levels are feelings that we would like to express most of the time but we are forced to repress them because of social rules, others’ expectations and many futile laws that we live by in modern society. Crankiness and despise remain too often buried inside us but the Grumpy Cat is our great chance to let it all out.

This disgruntled, surly-looking cat is actually named Tardar Sauce and lives happily (hard to believe!) in the Unites States. Her expression is due to a sickness of hers which, however, does not prevent her from a pretty normal cat life, and that won her an incredible fame on the internet. Tardar Sauce became a star in 2012, when her picture was posted on Reddit. From that moment on, grumpy people all around the world used her expressive face to finally speak their minds!

Forever Alone,"
                            One look at the Forever Alone meme, and one can see that image that has spawned not only sub-memes, but even influenced newer memes. There is something that has caught on and continues to do so, with the hastily drawn, somewhat scribbled-looking cartoonish image of a face. This is a good example of a quirky concept that takes off for an not immediately obvious reason. 
Perhaps it is in the attitude of the main character himself. Expressing his disillusionment and a cantankerous cynical outlook on life, the world, and everything, it appeared around 2010. 
The story behind it is almost more interesting than the meme itself. In 2011, a scheme was developed to create a flashmob in New York’s Times Square comprised entirely of men who had set up dates with fake users on the popular dating website OKCupid. The event crashed the servers of EarthCam, the camera company responsible for the cameras that show Times Square. The entire event was commemorated by a Forever Alone poster plastered to a phone booth in the area.
There are also several variations that have been made on the phrase Forever Alone, by changing one of the words, a la “Forever A Bone”, etc.

Good Guy Greg,"
                            Good Guy Greg is a refreshingly nice meme, a rare sort in the meme world. He may seem irresponsible at first, but once you get to know him, he’s a hilariously helpful guy.
The meme shows a photo of a man, smiling around a homemade cigarette. One can postulate that perhaps it is a joint. Okay, it is so totally a spliff. Perhaps this is what makes good Guy Greg such a good guy. He’s easygoing, kind, and just sort of chills out. He may not be the sharpest knife in the drawer. He may not get all the jokes. But he does nice things.
Good Guy Greg appears to be wearing a royal blue golf shirt, with the collar up. This should tell you a lot about him. If you told him that wasn’t cool, he would probably just smile and act surprised but go on wearing his shirts that way, anyway. It’s just the kind of guy he is.
The variations of this meme have Greg in full good guy mode, not quite getting the joke but still being really nice.
Notable examples of Good Guy Greg include his photo with the lines: “Disappears for half an hour – shows up with Burger King for everyone”, “Downloads a movie – Seeds until 1 ratio”, and “Gets Rick Roll’d – Listens until the end”.
To understand what a good guy Greg is, you have to understand how popular file and music sharing sites work. When you “seed”, you are being helpful so that other users can upload files more quickly. This is exactly the sort of thing Good Guy Greg excels at.

Scumbag Steve,"
                            There exist many scumbag memes on the internet, but one of the most popular is Scumbag Steve. We all have probably known a Scumbag Steve or twelve in our lives, and this meme personifies that person who thinks he is the proverbial “all that and a bag of chips”, while really, he is just a total douche.
Scumbag Steve shows a photo of a younger guy sporting a sideways cap and standing in a hallway. He has a look on his face that pretty clearly states “I am a douche”. The text that often accompanies his image focuses on behavior that can be deemed immoral, unethical, rude, and usually illegal.
The photo of Scumbag Steve actually, unlike other memes, has a known origin. It was taken off the cover of an album called Martin Gangsta, by the group Beantown Mafia. The identity of the man is even known, as it was discovered that the guy in question is actually Blake Boston, and the photo taken by his dear mother.
Blake, as subject of the photo in question, has publicly expressed his admiration ond like for marijuana, and subsequently many of the Scumbag Steve meme images have reflected that propensity. Boston’s predilection for cannabis notwithstanding, notable examples of Scumbag Steve pieces include references to stealing things, internet stalking, and throwing up on various things.
Some of Scumbag Steve’s attributed notable quotes include “Hey can I Borrow Everything?” and “Do You Want the Red Pill? Both”.
